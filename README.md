# School-Maps


## frameworks
### python  (Django/Flask)
easy to use and implement, lots of library's
may be slow to run pathfinder algorithms and things like that when on mobile devices
indentation

### Js/Ts (react/solid)
Not all of us are as good at each other when it comes to these library's but it does make it easer to style.

### Rust (Rocket/Actix Web)
Fast & nick gets to learn a good language
more complex to set up (i think, idk)
has web assembly
